== System Scope and Context


[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
System scope and context - as the name suggests - delimits your system (i.e. your scope) from all its communication partners
(neighboring systems and users, i.e. the context of your system). It thereby specifies the external interfaces.

If necessary, differentiate the business context (domain specific inputs and outputs) from the technical context (channels, protocols, hardware).

.Motivation
The domain interfaces and technical interfaces to communication partners are among your system's most critical aspects. Make sure that you completely understand them.

.Form
Various options:

* Context diagrams
* Lists of communication partners and their interfaces.

=== Business Context

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Specification of *all* communication partners (users, IT-systems, ...) with explanations of domain specific inputs and outputs or interfaces.
Optionally you can add domain specific formats or communication protocols.

.Motivation
All stakeholders should understand which data are exchanged with the environment of the system.

.Form
All kinds of diagrams that show the system as a black box and specify the domain interfaces to communication partners.

Alternatively (or additionally) you can use a table.
The title of the table is the name of your system, the three columns contain the name of the communication partner, the inputs, and the outputs.

- **WIChat** is a web application that allows users to register, log in, play "Saber y Ganar," and view statistics about their game performance.
- **Wikidata ** is a free and open knowledge base that serves as a central repository for structured data. Its API will be used to retrieve the information needed to generate questions and answers within the application.

- **Large Language Models (LLMs) ** are advanced AI systems designed to understand and generate human language.


=== Technical Context

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Technical interfaces (channels and transmission media) linking your system to its environment. In addition a mapping of domain specific input/output to the channels, i.e. an explanation which I/O uses which channel.

.Motivation
Many stakeholders make architectural decision based on the technical interfaces between the system and its context. Especially infrastructure or hardware designers decide these technical interfaces.

.Form
E.g. UML deployment diagram describing channels to neighboring systems,
together with a mapping table showing the relationships between channels and input/output.

Other elements of the system are:

- **WIChat Webapp:** The module responsible for user interaction through the UI, serving as the front-end of the entire system.
- **Image Generation Service**: An internal service that manages image generation based on data retrieved from Wikidata.
- **Gateway Service:** A public-facing Express service that acts as a proxy for user management, enabling sign-up and login.
- **User service:** An Express service that handles the registration of new users in the system.
- **LLM:** External Large Language Model the system uses to request hints about the image generated.
