== Runtime View

In this Runtime View section, some sequence diagrams of different interactions with the system will be shown.
Most diagrams are taken from the WIQ project, our base project, because that funcionality has not changed.
 You can find it in https://github.com/Arquisoft/wiq_es04a/tree/master/docs.

It has been changed MariaDB to SQLite.
