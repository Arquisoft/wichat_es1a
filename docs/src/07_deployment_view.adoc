== Deployment View

[role="arc42help"]

.Content
This part of the documentation for wichat_es1a explains the deployment view, which is in charge of:

 - technical infrastructure required to execute the system, for example environments, computing resources, network topologies, among other things.
 
 - maps the software building blocks to the infrastructure elements.

Since software typically operates across multiple environments, such as development environment, test environment, production environment. In such cases you should document all relevant and essential environments.

This documentation becomes especially crucial when the system is distributed system with more than one computer, processor, server or container or when you design and construct your own hardware processors and chips.

From a software perspective it is sufficient to capture only those elements of an infrastructure that are needed to show a deployment of your building blocks. No special or deep explanation is needed in this level.

In the other hand, hardware architects can go beyond that and describe an infrastructure to any level of detail they need to capture. Here, explaining and detailing this part of the documentation becomes an essential task.

.Motivation
Both software and hardware are complementary parts, since software does not run without a proper hardware.

Because of that, the infrastructure can and will influence a system and/or some cross-cutting concepts. 

Therefore, there is a need to know the infrastructure.

.Form

Maybe a highest level deployment diagram is already contained in (https://github.com/Arquisoft/wichat_es1a/blob/master/docs/src/03_system_scope_and_context.adoc[**Section 3.2**]) as
technical context with your own infrastructure as ONE black box. In this section one can
zoom into this black box using additional deployment diagrams:

* UML offers deployment diagrams to express that view. Use it, probably with nested diagrams,
when your infrastructure is more complex.
* When your (hardware) stakeholders prefer other kinds of diagrams rather than a deployment diagram, let them use any kind that is able to show nodes and channels of the infrastructure.

.Deployment approach

Our system is deployed using a single Azure Virtual Machine (VM), letting Docker Compose manage multiple containerized services.

These services will help us to simplify deployment, maintenance, and other features in the project.

The different containers used will be listed below:

- WebApp: The primary user interface that interacts with the system. Retrieves data from the Gateway Service.
- Gateway Service: Data access interface for services.
- Users: Manages everything related to users, for example authentification.
- LLMService: Manages LLM chat with the user to help them with the questions generated.
- Two databases, which are:
- MongoDB: for questions management (store the questions with the distractors and the correct answer from a specified JSON file, and do several things with that information).
- SQLite: for users management (create various roles, e.g. User,  which has many parameters, a group of users and groups, among others).
- Questions: Generates questions to use in the game. The questions will have three wrong answers and one correct answer.
