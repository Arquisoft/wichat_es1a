== Cross-cutting Concepts

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
This section describes overall, principal regulations and solution ideas that are relevant in multiple parts (= cross-cutting) of your system.
Such concepts are often related to multiple building blocks and secures consistency and integrity.

They can include many different topics, such as:

- models, especially domain models, which are important for the deployment of the project.
- architecture or design patterns.
- rules for using specific technology, to find out what we have implemented and why.
- principal, often technical decisions of an overarching (= cross-cutting) nature.
- implementation rules.


.Motivation
The most important concepts that our project will follow are the basis for _conceptual integrity_ (consistency, homogeneity) of the architecture. 

Thus, they are an important contribution to achieve inner qualities of your system.

Some of these concepts cannot be assigned to individual building blocks, e.g. security or safety. 


.Form
The form can be varied in many different ways:

* concept papers with any kind of structure.
* cross-cutting model excepts or scenarios using notations of the architecture views.
* sample implementations, especially for technical concepts.
* reference to typical usage of standard frameworks (e.g. using Hibernate for object/relational mapping).

.Structure
A potential (but not mandatory) structure for this section could be:

* Domain Concepts.
* User Experience Concepts (UX).
* Safety and security Concepts.
* Architecture and design patterns.
* "Under-the-hood".
* Development Concepts.
* Operational Concepts.

Note: it might be difficult to assign individual concepts to one specific topic
on this list.

Some important concepts need to be taken into account so as to a better understanding of the application. These concepts have to do with the following categories.

. Domain concepts.
. User Experience (UX).
. Operation Concepts.
. Architecture and Design Patterns.
. Development Concepts.

Next, each category will be detailed.

=== Domain concepts
At the moment, the application follows this schema:

image::08_domain_model_1.png["Current version of the domain model"]

* **User**: it is the person that uses the application. Multiple user sessions are an option in this application. 
* **Contest**: The contest is the part that the User can see. It contains everything the user can do, such as play games, be part of groups or look for rankings and statistics.
* **Game**: The User can play the game here.
* **Question**: Each question has different answers but only one of them is correct. Answering correctly to the questions rewards users with _points_.
* **Statistics**: Each user has statistics that show different aspects of their profile, such as the time they invested on each game mode, correct and incorrect questions, etc.
* **Profile**: User's profile has data such as their username and the amount on _points_ they have earned. They can also choose a profile picture from between some given avatars.
* **Group**: Users are able to join or create groups, that way the can get to a groups ranking.


=== User Experience (UX)
This part is currently in progress.

=== Operation Concepts
- Usability: We tried for the application to be easy to use. For this reason, we will try to spread this application to several types of persons, to complete and expand its strengths and weaknesses and improve them. 
- Usability affects User Experience as well, so it is an important aspect of the application.


=== Security
* We have implemented some security in the application, which will be listed now. 
- Some blocked sites if the user is not logged in an account: This way, we avoid external people to be able to access our application as it could lead to other security issues.
- Passwords with a minimal security level: They need to be at least 8 characters longs and they must contain upper and lower letters, numbers and special characters. 
- Encrypted passwords: In case that the batabase is stolen, data would still be secure and the passwords will contain other things, which will improve more the security of the app. 

=== Architecture and Design Patterns
- https://arquisoft.github.io/wiq_es04a/#_technical_terms[**Microservice**]: In this application there are some microservices such as the User Management, which involves signing up, logging in and everything related to the points and timing of the user. Microservices provide an easy way of creating a complex application composed by independent systems.
- Questions generation system: It is a microservice that creates infinite questions related to several topics, with only one type of questions: related to images. In that type of question, an image will be given for the user to guess what it is, with only one correct answer and three distractors.
- Graphic interface: Users are able to communicate with the application to this service.
- Generation of the hints with LLM: the app will comunicate with a LLM to provide hints of the question, trying to be accurate with the answer.

=== Development Concepts
- **Testing**: Includes unit tests for each functionality and end-to-end (e2e) tests for core gameplay features.
- https://arquisoft.github.io/wiq_es04a/#_acronyms[**CI/CD**]: The application is in continuous integration and deployment. Team members commit frequently into the repository where the project is stored. This makes it easier when assembling project parts involving collaboration from different team members.
