== Appendix I: Load Tests

.Content
This section outlines the load testing performed to evaluate the system's performance and stability under simulated user demand. Using Gatling,
we conducted tests to measure how the system handles concurrent users.

We recorded the specific functionalities to be tested and configured Gatling to simulate user interactions.
Our initial test involved gradually increasing the number of concurrent requests to 1,000 over a 2-minute ramp-up period, mimicking a realistic usage scenario.
The configuration details for this test are summarized below:

*Configuration for Gatling Recording 1*
- Ramp-up period: 2 minutes
- Target users: 1,000
- Test duration: 6 minutes (22:59 to 23:05)

After executing the load test, we analyzed the results.
Approximately 33% of requests failed. The majority of successful requests (around 40%) had response times between 800 and 1,200 ms,
 while 35% were under 800 ms, as shown in the response time distribution.
While response times were acceptable, reducing the failure rate is a priority to ensure a seamless user experience.

The following graphs illustrate the test results, showing request failures, response times, and active users over the simulation period.
