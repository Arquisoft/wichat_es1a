== Load Tests

.Content
This section describes the load testing activities conducted to assess the system's performance,
 stability, and behavior under varying levels of demand. The objective was to identify potential bottlenecks,
  evaluate scalability, and ensure the system can handle real-world usage scenarios. 

- **Load Testing**: Several load tests were performed to evaluate the system's performance under different conditions. From these, we selected three representative scenarios:
  1. A test where the system begins to slow down under high load, though it never crashes.
  2. A scenario with multiple concurrent users where everything works smoothly and quickly.
  3. A case where the testing tool itself ran out of space due to the volume of data generated.
