== Appendix II: Other Tests

=== Unit Tests 
Throughout the development of the application, we consistently implemented unit tests. These tests were key to verifying that newly added features worked correctly. They also made it easier to catch unintended changes â€” if something was modified, we would adjust the unit tests accordingly. This helped us spot unexpected impacts on other parts of the application and identify unwanted dependencies between components.
For these reasons, maintaining a high level of test coverage was a priority. We successfully achieved over 80% code coverage across the project.

==== SonarCloud
The image below provides an overview of our repository as analyzed by SonarCloud. As shown, all services have reached at least 80% coverage, with some nearing 90%. Overall, the project maintains an average coverage of about 82%. However, it's important to note that good testing is not just about high numbers, but about meaningful, effective coverage.

Additionally, SonarCloud offers a graphic showing risk levels across different parts of the codebase. Bubbles located in the top-right area of the graph indicate potential long-term risks, while green bubbles in the bottom-left represent healthy code. In our case, the graphic shows all green bubbles, with most positioned in the safest zone at the bottom-left.

=== Usability Tests 
To evaluate how intuitive and accessible our application is for end users, we conducted a series of usability tests involving five participants: three with prior experience using similar applications, and two with no prior experience.

Each user was asked to perform the following tasks:

* Register an account

* Access the game mode

* Complete a game session

All participants successfully completed all tasks without external help.

Results Summary:

Experienced users:

* Average task completion time: 1:39 minutes

* Reported being satisfied with the interface and flow

Inexperienced users:

* Average task completion time: 2:47 minutes

* Also reported satisfaction and found the application easy to learn

These results suggest that the application provides a user-friendly experience for both novice and experienced users, with no significant usability barriers.
